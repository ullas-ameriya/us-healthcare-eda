# 🩺 US Health Insurance Cost Prediction – A Hands-On Data Science Project

Welcome to my first hands-on data science project using a real-world dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset). This project explores various stages of the data science workflow—from exploratory data analysis to machine learning model implementation and optimization.

> **Goal:** Learn by doing, showcase my growing skill set, and help others who want to follow a beginner-friendly path into machine learning and data analysis.

## 📘 What This Project Covers

The Jupyter Notebook walks through the following steps in detail:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Loading the CSV and exploring the basic structure
- Removing duplicates and handling missing values
- Visualizing patterns in data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Comparing numerical features (e.g., Age vs. Charges, BMI vs. Charges)
- Exploring categorical influences (e.g., Region, Smoker status)

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning and preparing data for modeling
- Feature encoding of categorical variables
- Feature scaling to normalize the input space

### 3. Feature Engineering and Selection
- Identifying important variables that influence the prediction

### 4. Model Building
- Framing the problem: Supervised Regression
- Trying different algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost, LGBMRegressor
- Evaluating model performance

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimizing model performance using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search
